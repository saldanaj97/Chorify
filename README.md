## General Info 
This project was created to help individuals find available service providers nearby when there is a job that needs to get done. For example, say you need to get the oil changed on your car. You could simply buy the oil and request a provider through our app which could potentially be cheaper and faster than taking your car in to the dealership. 

This app is a two part system like Uber with their a driver app and user app. I only did the user application and populated the database wtih example service providers for users to see. 

## Technologies 
This application was created with: 
* Flutter 
* Dart
* Cloud Firestore

## Setup 
If you want to download the code for this application to test the application yourself, below are the steps to getting it running. If you only want to see how the application looks, screenshots are attached below these instructions in the screenshots section. 
1. Download and install Flutter from this link https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Open the code in an IDE or code editor such as Android Studio or VSCode (my preference)
3. If you do not have an Android phone, install an android emulator. Linked is a good article with instructions on how to do so: https://medium.com/michael-wallace/how-to-install-android-sdk-and-setup-avd-emulator-without-android-studio-aeb55c014264
4. Next, make sure you are in the correct directory and type:
```
$ flutter run
```
5. The application should now open up and begin running.

* Connecting a frontend to a backend
* Creating a mobile application
* Using a NoSQL database(Cloud Firestore)
* Flutter/Dart
